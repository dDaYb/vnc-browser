# VNC-iPad
A Lightweight, Ready-to-Use Web Browsing Environment in Docker with VNC Access

## Info :information_source:
VNC-ipad is a minimal Docker image designed to provide a lightweight environment for browsing the web via VNC.
This Docker image encapsulates a lightweight, VNC-accessible Chromium web browser starting in kiosk mode.
It allows to use old iPad as a remote for home assistant (native outdated safari browser of old ipad is unusable for this purporse).
You should install any vnc viewer on ipad (available on all versions of ipad)

**Key Features ‚ú®**

- **VNC-Ready**: Ready for use with any VNC client or through a web browser using noVNC, offering a user-friendly interface.
- **Lightweight**: Built on Alpine Linux and Debian Slim, ensuring minimal resource usage.
- **Customizable**: Set VNC password, initial website URL, auto-start settings for the browser and xterm via environment variables.
- **Accessible**: Access the VNC server directly or through a browser using noVNC.
